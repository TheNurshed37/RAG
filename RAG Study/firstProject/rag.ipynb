He\\nhad assumed he would soon return to his sheep.\\n“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get away\\nfrom the business of the display.\\n“Because I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered,\\nsaying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but a\\npainful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.\\n“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the\\ndesert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a\\npile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”\\n“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to wait\\non a customer who had entered the shop.\\nTwo days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display.\\n\\nwith the animals.

But she said nothing.\\n“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words\\nslowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to\\nme, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as\\nshe was about to show me the exact location, I woke up.

Ten years at the university,\\nand here I am in a corral.\\nBut he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all\\nhis studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the\\nuniverse. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions,\\nand now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he\\nunderstood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an\\nalchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions,\\nbut his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not\\nseem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an\\nalchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only\\n\\n“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all\\nnight, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop.

But she said nothing.\\n“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,”—he said the last three words\\nslowly, so that the old woman would understand—“the child said to\\nme, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as\\nshe was about to show me the exact location, I woke up.

In 1980, he experienced\\none of the defining moments of his life: he walked the five hundred–\\nplus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain.\\nOn this ancient highway, used for centuries by pilgrims from France\\nto get to the cathedral said to house the remains of St. James, he\\n\\x0cachieved a self-awareness and a spiritual awakening that he later\\ndescribed in The Pilgrimage.\\nPaulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like learning\\na foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get there in\\nthe end. In 1988, he published The Alchemist, a novel that explores\\nthis theme, and it launched him as an international bestselling\\nauthor. Specifically, Paulo Coelho is recognized for his powerful\\nstorytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights he blends\\n\\nheart and soul. I am Santiago the shepherd boy in search of my\\ntreasure, just as you are Santiago the shepherd boy in search of\\nyour own. The story of one person is the story of everyone, and one\\nman’s quest is the quest of all of humanity, which is why I believe\\nThe Alchemist continues all these years later to resonate with people\\nfrom different cultures all around the world, touching them\\nemotionally and spiritually, equally, without prejudice.\\nI re-read The Alchemist regularly and every time I do I experience\\nthe same sensations I felt when I wrote it. And here is what I feel. I\\nfeel happiness, because it is all of me, and all of you simultaneously.\\nI feel happiness, too, because I know I can never be alone.\\nWherever I go, people understand me. They understand my soul.\\nThis continues to give me hope. When I read about clashes around\\n\\x0cthe world—political clashes, economic clashes, cultural clashes—I\\nam reminded that it is within our power to build a bridge to be\\n\\nhe knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to\\nexplain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to\\nread. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His\\nparents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of\\npride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food\\nand water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and\\n\\x0ctheology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know\\nthe world, and this was much more important to him than knowing\\nGod and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his\\nfamily, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he\\ndidn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.\\n“People from all over the world have passed through this village,\\nson,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when\\nthey leave they are basically the same people they were when they\\narrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up\\n\\neighty different languages, the most translated book by any living\\nauthor, and is widely considered one of the ten best books of the\\ntwentieth century.\\nPeople continue to ask me if I knew The Alchemist would be such\\na huge success. The answer is no. I had no idea. How could I?\\nWhen I sat down to write The Alchemist, all I knew is that I wanted to\\nwrite about my soul. I wanted to write about my quest to find my\\ntreasure. I wanted to follow the omens, because I knew even then\\nthat the omens are the language of God.\\nThough The Alchemist is now celebrating its twenty-fifth\\nanniversary, it is no relic of the past. The book is still very much\\nalive. Like my heart and like my soul, it continues to live every day,\\nbecause my heart and soul are in it. And my heart and soul is your\\nheart and soul.

The story of one person is the story of everyone, and one\\n\\nthat held three ancient Spanish gold coins.\\n“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of\\nyour inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields,\\nand someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our\\nwomen are the most beautiful.”\\n\\x0cAnd he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his\\nfather’s gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a\\ndesire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it,\\nover dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to\\ndrink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.\\nThe horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared.\\nThe boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt\\nhappy; he had already seen many castles and met many women\\n(but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days\\nhence).
